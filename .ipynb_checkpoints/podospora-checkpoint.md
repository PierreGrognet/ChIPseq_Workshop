# *Podospora anserina*

*Podospora anserina* is a filamentous fungus widely used as a model system to study various processes such as development, ageing, prions, etc. The genes responsible for histones posttranslational modifications are also well conserved, making *P. anserina* a handy alternative to higher eukaryotes to study the role of epigenetics in development and genome stability.

*P. anserina* grows fast on axenic medium (about 7 mm per day) and can complete it's life cycle in a week.

During its life cycle (Figure 2), a spermatium, acting as the male
gamete, from one of the two mating types, mat+ or mat- , fertilizes an ascogonium, the female
organ, of the other mating type, initiating sexual reproduction. A hook-shaped crozier cell
containing one haploid nucleus from each mating type then forms. The nuclei undergo
duplication and one duplicate from each mating type then separate into a dikaryotic cell
where they undergo karyogamy, beginning the brief diploid phase of the life cycle, as meiosis
initiates immediately. Following meiosis and a post-meiotic mitosis, haploid nuclei of
different mating types are packaged into ascospores, which are ejected to begin the cycle
anew. Normal development of P. anserina thus requires tight regulation of the complex
mechanisms directing these developmental processes.
