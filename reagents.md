## Magnetic beads

Dynabeads protein A Invitrogen 10001D

Vortex (> 30sec) the beads.

Then, the beads must be washed before use:\
> Aliquot 250 µl of beads and place on the magnetic rack\
  Wash with [Lysis buffer](Lysis_Buffer.md), 1 ml / 250 µl of beads, 3 min, at RT\
  Collect the beads and resuspend in 250 µl [Lysis buffer](Lysis_Buffer.md)\
  Store at 4°C\
  \
  
 NB: the volume of beads you wash can be scaled according to your needs
