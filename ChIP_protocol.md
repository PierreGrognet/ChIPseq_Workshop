# ChIP protocol


## Preparation of mycelium

Culture
- Inoculate 6 Roux bottles of 100 ml of medium with a fresh mycelium (grown 1 or 2 days on M2 medium at 27Â°C).
- Incubate 62 hours in the dark at 27Â°C.

Fixation
- Filter the mycelium on gauze, rinse once with PBS at room temperature.
- Fix in 100ml of PBS 1X + 2.5 ml Formaldehyde 37%, shake 15 min at 27Â°C. _Careful: Formaldehyde is toxix, work with appropriate safety equipements (gloves, chemical hood)_
- Stop with 2.5 ml of Glycine 2.5 M (shake for 5 min).

Grinding and storage (In cold room)
- Filter the mycelium (_the flow-through needs to be discarded in appropriate liquid trash bin_)
- Wash twice with cold PBS
- Dry on wattman paper (do not hesitate to press the mycelium)
- Grind with liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle.  _Careful: Use appropriate safety equipments_
- Weigh and store at -80Â°C in 50 mL Falcon tubes (transport in liquid nitrogen).

 

### Day 1

#### Lysis and chromatin digestion 

- In the cold room : Weigh approximately 200 mg of mycelium (cool the spatula in liquid nitrogen before each sample, no more than 2 samples after removal of the mycelium from liquid nitrogen)
- In the ice: Resuspend the mycelium with 1 mL of [Lysis buffer](Lysis_Buffer.md) (+proteinase inhibitor + CaCl2)
- Mix well 10 times going back and forth with the P1000, vortex, leave 10 min on ice, vortex again.
- Add 5Î¼l of Micrococcale Nuclease and incubate 20-30 min at 37Â°C (in the water bath) (+ a control without MNase to check digestion), 
- Gently mix the tubes every 2 min to resuspend the mycelium.
- Stop the reaction with 30 Î¼l of EGTA pH 8 0.5 M , incubate 5 min on ice.
- Centrifuge 3-5 min at 4Â°C at top speed, 
- Recover the supernatant (= soluble chromatin), 
- Repeat the centrifugation to remove as much as possible the undigested genomic DNA.
- Quantify the chromatin (with [QuBit](QuBit.md), following the QuBit kit protocol). You may need to dilute an aliquot of the chromatin beforehand.

(Possibility of storing -80 Â° C at this stage, but for the ChIP it is better to avoid the thawing steps).


#### Checking of chromatin fragmentation (nucleosomal digestion pattern)

* Save a 50ÂµL aliqot of Micrococcale digested chromatin in a fresh tube, then add:
     + RNAse A (20mg/ml) 10 Î¼l, 60 min at 37Â°C
     + Proteinase K (20mg/ml) 10 Î¼l, 120 min at 65Â°C
     + SDS to 0.5% 
     + Incubate at 65Â°C over night to reverse the crosslink





### Day 2

#### Phenol extraction of the DNA

Adjust the volume to 600 Âµl.
**Carefull! Phenol and chloroform must be used under the fume hood!**


To the tube kept over-night at 65Â°C, add:

* 300Î¼l phenol
* 300Î¼l chloroform 
* mix or vortex, 
* centrifuge 3 min (top speed, room temperature)
* recover the aqueous phase in a fresh tube
* 600 Î¼l chloroform
* centrifuge 3 min (top speed, room temperature)
* recover the aqueous phase in a fresh tube


#### Ethanol precipitation:



+ Add 1/100th of glycogen
+ Add 1/10th Sodium Acetate 3 M. Mix
+ Add 2.5 volume of Ethanol 100%
+ Centrifuge 10 min 16000g, 4Â°C, carefully remove the supernatant without aspirating the pelet.
+ Add 500 Î¼l cold ethanol 70% 
+ Centrifuge 10 min 16000g, 4Â°C, carefully remove the supernatant without aspirating the pelet.
+ Air dry for 10-20 min
+ Resuspend in 50 Î¼l H2O
+ Load 10Î¼l (+ 2Î¼l of loading buffer) on a 1.5% agarose gel. Run 40 min at 50V.

## ChiP:

Dilution the chromatin : 

- If needed, thaw the chromatin on ice.
- Seed 5Âµg of chromatin in a fresh tube. Adjust the volume to 1.1 ml with  cold [Lysis buffer](Lysis_Buffer.md) + protease inhibitor. Keep the tube on ice.

**Prepare as many tube as necessary for the different IPs and controls you will need**


In the cold room:

- Pre-clearing: add 30 Î¼l of magnetic beads to the chromatin. Incubate 3-4h at 4Â°C on a rotating wheel.(see [here](reagents.md) for indication on beads preparation)
- Place the tubes on a magnetic rack for 2-3 min and recover the supernatant in a fresh tube. Keep the tube on ice.
- Save 100 Î¼l (= Input) to a new tube and freeze at -80Â°C
- Add the appropriate amount of antibody to the rest (1 ml). Incubate over night at 4Â°C on a rotating wheel, **do not forget a sample without Antibodies (Ac0)**

 

**Caution**: 1 Tube (5Î¼g) = 1 Precipitation with 1 antibody. Prepare 1 tube for each replicate of each antibody.

 
 
 

### Day 3

#### Binding and washes

- Add 20Î¼l of magnetic beads, incubate 4h at 4Â°C on a rotating wheel.
