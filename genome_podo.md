# *Podospora anserina*'s genome

## Genome sequence



This is a fasta file that contains the whole genome sequence.
[Genome](genome_podo/genomePodoMatPlus.fasta)
This is a multifasta file with 7 fasta sequences corresponding to the 7 chromosomes.

We remind you that *P. anserina* as most fungi can have two mating types that control the sexual compatibility. In *P. anserina* there are called *mat*+ and *mat*-.
The sequenced strain was *mat*+, that's why the file name ends with "MatPlus".
The mating type locus is located on the 1st chromosome, that's why it's called Chr1plus in the fasta file.

You'll also find bellow 7 fasta files for the 7 chromosomes.
[Chromosome 1](genome_podo/chrm1plus.fasta)
[Chromosome 2](genome_podo/chrm2.fasta)
[Chromosome 3](genome_podo/chrm3.fasta)
[Chromosome 4](genome_podo/chrm4.fasta)
[Chromosome 5](genome_podo/chrm5.fasta)
[Chromosome 6](genome_podo/chrm6.fasta)
[Chromosome 7](genome_podo/chrm7.fasta)

## Annotation

Here a gff file containing the genome annotation:
[Genome annotation](Annotation_Mat+_v2.gff)

It contains coordinates and information of coding sequences (CDS), repeats, tRNA, centromeres etc.


## Chromosome sizes

Here a file containing the size of each chromosome:
[Chromosome sizes](Chr_size.txt)

Some programs need this information.
