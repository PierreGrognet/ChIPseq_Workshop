# ChIP

**Goal = isolate all DNA regions bound to a specific protein**

This figure is a simplified representation of the ChIP procedure.

1. Many proteins bind to DNA (eg. transcription factors, histones, etc.). Before extracting the chromatin, covalent bound are created between DNA and proteins. This is called "cross-linking". The cross-linking is performed by treating the cells with PFA (paraformaldehyde).

2. After extraction, the chromatin is sheared into small fragments either by sonication or thanks to enzyme such as the Micrococcal nuclease.

3. An antibody raised against the protein of interest is added to the sheared chromatin...

4. ... and binds to its target (here, the orange protein).

5. We then add magnetics beads coated with proteins called Protein G or Protein A. These proteins are able to bind the constant part of IgG.

6. The magnetic beads bound to the chromatin-protein-antibody complex is precipitated with a magnet. They stay stuck to tube while the rest is discarded with the supernatant.
